    "* API keys\n",
    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png) before somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information.\n",
    "\n",

They also ran out of almond milk so that sort of stunk for the drinks we initially wanted.\\n\\nWe sat outside and were seated right away, just beat the rush as it soon became busy. We were very hungry: ordered the cinnamon roll as an appetizer to split, the breakfast pizza to split, the eggs benedict with shrimp, and the burrito (mostly pictured in my added photos to this review). They were all quite delicious however the portions are pretty large for me and we had a lot of leftovers. The pizza wasn't my favorite but it was different. The burrito I ate the other half for breakfast the next day (today!).\\n\\nI didn't take a photo of the menu, regrettably, but I thought it was sort of limited for breakfast/lunch however the restaurant isn't all that big either so it is expected. I really like the location despite the parking issue as you're in the center of Pitt's campus and it is just a beautiful location to sit outside and get a nice view of Oakland/enjoy the outdoor area.
